# BC-2.16.015: Decode-vs-Analysis Separation — DecodedFrame::Arp Always Produced; Analysis Gated on --arp

## Description

The architectural separation between decoding and analysis for ARP frames is a two-stage
invariant: (1) `decode_packet` ALWAYS returns `Ok(DecodedFrame::Arp(ArpFrame { ... }))` for
well-formed Ethernet/IPv4 ARP frames regardless of whether `--arp` is present, and (2)
`ArpAnalyzer::process_arp` is called ONLY when `--arp` is active. This mirrors the
decode-vs-analysis pattern established for IP frames (decoded regardless of which analyzer
flags are set) and ensures that the decode path is always exercised, making it observable in
tests even without `--arp`. This BC is an architectural invariant BC, not a detection BC —
it specifies the structural pipeline guarantee rather than a security finding.

## Preconditions

1. An Ethernet frame with EtherType 0x0806 is received by `decode_packet`.
2. etherparse 0.20 successfully parses the frame as having `NetSlice::Arp(ArpPacketSlice)`.
3. `extract_arp_frame` returns `Some(ArpFrame { ... })` (Ethernet/IPv4 format).

## Postconditions

**Decode stage (always, regardless of --arp flag):**
1. `decode_packet` returns `Ok(DecodedFrame::Arp(frame))`.
2. The `DecodedFrame::Arp` variant is always produced for well-formed Ethernet/IPv4 ARP frames.
3. No Err is returned from `decode_packet` for well-formed Ethernet/IPv4 ARP (this represents
   the BC-2.02.009 revision: the old behavior of returning `Err("No IP layer found")` for ARP
   is retired).

**Analysis stage (gated on --arp):**
4. When `--arp` is active: `main.rs` calls `arp_analyzer.process_arp(&frame, ts)` for every
   `DecodedFrame::Arp(frame)` in the main packet loop.
5. When `--arp` is absent: `main.rs` pattern-matches on `DecodedFrame::Arp(frame)` but
   performs no action on it (the frame is acknowledged and discarded).
6. In neither case does the `DecodedFrame::Arp` arm fall through to the IP pipeline; ARP frames
   never reach `StreamDispatcher`, the reassembler, or any `ProtocolAnalyzer`.

**Malformed ARP frames (non-Ethernet/IPv4):**
7. When `extract_arp_frame` returns `None` (malformed per BC-2.16.009 precondition):
   `decode_packet` returns `Err("Non-Ethernet/IPv4 ARP frame")`. This is not a `DecodedFrame::Arp`
   — the malformed frame is an error, not a successfully decoded frame.

## Invariants

1. **Decode is always performed**: `DecodedFrame::Arp` production is unconditional for
   well-formed Ethernet/IPv4 ARP. Analysis is conditional on `--arp`. This prevents the
   decode path from being dead code that breaks under etherparse 0.20's non-exhaustive
   `NetSlice` enum, regardless of user flags.
2. **ARP bypasses IP pipeline entirely**: ARP frames exit `decode_packet` as
   `DecodedFrame::Arp` and never reach `strict_ip_triple`, `lax_ip_triple`, `StreamDispatcher`,
   TCP reassembly, or any `ProtocolAnalyzer`. The `unreachable!` arms in `strict_ip_triple`
   and `lax_ip_triple` (ADR-008 Decision 3) are compile-safety nets, not runtime paths.
3. **BC-2.02.009 revision embodied here**: the old BC-2.02.009 postcondition (ARP frames →
   `Err("No IP layer found")`) is superseded. This BC and the revised BC-2.02.009 together
   describe the complete decoder ARP postcondition set.
4. **VP-008 obligation**: the cargo-fuzz harness for VP-008 (`decode_packet` no-panic) must
   accept `Result<DecodedFrame>` — both `Ip` and `Arp` variants are non-panic outcomes. The
   no-panic invariant is unchanged; only the return type broadens (ADR-008 §Decision 1).

## Edge Cases

| ID | Description | Expected Behavior |
|----|-------------|-------------------|
| EC-001 | Well-formed Ethernet/IPv4 ARP frame; `--arp` absent | `Ok(DecodedFrame::Arp)` from decode_packet; Arp arm in main.rs: no action |
| EC-002 | Well-formed Ethernet/IPv4 ARP frame; `--arp` present | `Ok(DecodedFrame::Arp)` from decode_packet; Arp arm: process_arp called |
| EC-003 | Non-Ethernet/IPv4 ARP frame (malformed) | `Err("Non-Ethernet/IPv4 ARP frame")` from decode_packet; not DecodedFrame::Arp |
| EC-004 | Non-ARP non-IP frame (e.g. LLDP, EtherType 0x88CC) | `Err("No IP layer found")` (unchanged path — net==None) |
| EC-005 | IPv4 frame (EtherType 0x0800) | `Ok(DecodedFrame::Ip(ParsedPacket))` (IP path, unchanged) |
| EC-006 | IPv6 frame (EtherType 0x86DD) | `Ok(DecodedFrame::Ip(ParsedPacket))` (IP path, unchanged) |
| EC-007 | NetSlice::Arp in strict_ip_triple | `unreachable!("ARP frames are routed before strict_ip_triple")` — compile-safety arm, never reached at runtime |

## Canonical Test Vectors

| Frame type | `--arp` flag | `decode_packet` result | `process_arp` called? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Ethernet/IPv4 ARP Request | absent | Ok(DecodedFrame::Arp) | NO |
| Ethernet/IPv4 ARP Reply | present | Ok(DecodedFrame::Arp) | YES |
| Non-Eth/IPv4 ARP (hw_size=8) | present | Err("Non-Ethernet/IPv4 ARP frame") | NO (not a DecodedFrame::Arp) |
| LLDP frame (non-ARP non-IP) | present | Err("No IP layer found") | NO |
| TCP/IPv4 frame | present | Ok(DecodedFrame::Ip) | NO (IP pipeline) |

## Verification Properties

| VP-NNN | Property | Proof Method |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| VP-008 | decode_packet no-panic: both DecodedFrame::Ip and DecodedFrame::Arp variants are non-panic outcomes; fuzz harness must be updated to accept Result<DecodedFrame> | cargo-fuzz: arbitrary input bytes; assert no panic for any input (both Ok variants and Err are valid non-panic outcomes) |

## Traceability

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| L2 Capability | CAP-16 ("ARP Security Analysis") per ARCH-INDEX.md §SS-16 |
| Capability Anchor Justification | CAP-16 ("ARP Security Analysis") per ARCH-INDEX.md §SS-16 — the decode-vs-analysis separation is the foundational architectural invariant enabling the ARP Security Analysis capability: decode is always exercised (correctness and fuzz coverage), analysis is opt-in (performance and noise control) |
| L2 Domain Invariants | (none directly) |
| Architecture Module | SS-16 + SS-02 (src/decoder.rs DecodedFrame enum + decode_packet; src/main.rs packet loop); ADR-008 Decisions 1–3 |
| Stories | STORY-112 |
| Feature | arp-security-analyzer |
| MITRE Techniques | (none — architectural invariant; no finding emission) |

## Source Evidence

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Path** | ADR-008 Decision 1 (return type change, main.rs pattern-match), Decision 3 (unreachable! arms), Decision 4 (ArpAnalyzer structure) |
| **Confidence** | high — this is a structural/architectural invariant, not a detection heuristic; the invariant is mechanically enforced by the Rust enum match exhaustiveness |

## Purity Classification

| Property | Assessment |
|----------|-----------|
| **I/O operations** | decode_packet: reads raw bytes (effectful shell input); decode logic is pure |
| **Global state access** | none |
| **Deterministic** | yes |
| **Thread safety** | single-threaded |
| **Overall classification** | architectural invariant spanning effectful shell (main.rs) + pure core (decoder.rs) |
