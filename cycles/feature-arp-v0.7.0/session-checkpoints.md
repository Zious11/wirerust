# Session Checkpoints Archive — ARP Analyzer feature-arp-v0.7.0

Archived per content-routing rules (STATE.md keeps only the LATEST checkpoint).

## Archived Checkpoint: 2026-06-12 — ARP Feature F1 PASSED / F2 PENDING

**Archived from STATE.md on:** 2026-06-13 (replaced by "F2 STRICT WHOLE-CORPUS CONVERGENCE, mid-loop" checkpoint)

### POSITION

wirerust **v0.6.0 RELEASED 2026-06-12**. Feature: ARP security analyzer + etherparse
0.16→0.20.1 migration — **F1 Delta Analysis PASSED** (human-gated 2026-06-12, D-066).
**F2 Spec Evolution was NEXT** (at time of archival, F2 is IN PROGRESS — 13 passes run).

**F1 outcome:** DecodedFrame{Ip,Arp} integration approach selected. ADR-008 planned.
ArpAnalyzer owns bounded IP↔MAC binding table. etherparse 0.20 migration is sub-delta A
(SliceError::Len removed; 2 non-exhaustive match breaks; DecodedFrame return-type change).
Estimate: 18-24 new BCs (SS-16), 1 revised BC (BC-2.02.009), VP-024, ADR-008, 5-6 stories
(E-16), 3-5 holdout scenarios. MITRE T0830 (primary) + T1557.002 (secondary) — validated
ATT&CK v19.1.

### RESUMING-ORCHESTRATOR RUNBOOK (at time of archival)

1. `vsdd-factory:factory-worktree-health` — verify `.factory/` on `factory-artifacts` branch.
2. Read `STATE.md`. Confirm develop==origin/develop, working tree clean.
3. `bin/compute-input-hash --scan` — expect MATCH=62 STALE=0 ERROR=1 (STORY-091 known).
4. Active phase was **Feature F2 Spec Evolution** — dispatch `vsdd-factory:phase-f2-spec-evolution`.

## Archived Checkpoint: 2026-06-13 — Pass 21 REMEDIATED; 0C/0H cosmetic; Slices A+C CLEAN 2nd consecutive

**Archived from STATE.md on:** 2026-06-13 (replaced by "Pass 22 REMEDIATED; 0C/0H; 5th consecutive; version-pin hardened" checkpoint)

### POSITION

- **21 adversarial passes + 1 corpus consistency audit run. Pass 21 REMEDIATED.**
- F2 adversarial convergence: STRICT WHOLE-CORPUS mode. Counter 0/3.
- Pass 21 (5 findings): 0C/0H; all cosmetic/ledger hygiene. B-01 LOW (PO): BC-INDEX ss-11
  table stray blank line between BC-2.11.001 and BC-2.11.002 split the Markdown table —
  removed (BC-INDEX v1.24→v1.25). D-01 MED (PO): spec-changelog Pass-13 ledger cited
  `specs/behavioral-contracts/ARCH-INDEX.md` — corrected to `specs/architecture/ARCH-INDEX.md`.
  D-02 MED (PO): spec-changelog Pass-13 ledger cited `vp-005-no-panic-guarantee.md` — corrected
  to `vp-005-sni-four-way-classification.md`. D-03 MED (PO): spec-changelog Pass-13 ledger cited
  `vp-008-all-analyzers-pure.md` — corrected to `vp-008-decode-packet-no-panic.md`. D-04 LOW (PO):
  PRD body version-history missing delta notes for 1.13/1.14/1.15/1.16/1.18; notes added (prd.md
  v1.18→v1.19). Slices A+C CLEAN (2nd consecutive clean for both slices).
  Trajectory P14-21: 2C/5H→2C/1H→0C/0H→3C/2H→0C/3H→0C/8H→0C/1H→0C/0H. DECAYING strongly.
- Next action at time of archival: whole-corpus Pass 22 via Claude (first-clean candidate).

## Archived Checkpoint: 2026-06-13 — F2 STRICT WHOLE-CORPUS CONVERGENCE, Pass 22 REMEDIATED; 0C/0H; 5th consecutive; version-pin hardened

**Archived from STATE.md on:** 2026-06-13 (replaced by "Pass 23 REMEDIATED; B/C/D CLEAN" checkpoint)

### POSITION

- **22 adversarial passes + 1 corpus consistency audit run. Pass 22 REMEDIATED.**
- F2 adversarial convergence: STRICT WHOLE-CORPUS mode. Counter 0/3.
- Pass 22 (8 raw findings; 3 discarded no-action/NON-BLOCKING; 5 valid): 0C/0H. C-01 MED
  (domain-debt O-04: "21 IDs"→"23 IDs" — Feature #8 DNP3 +2; domain-debt v1.2→v1.3). A-01 LOW
  (verification-architecture: Pass-22 modified entry wording hardened; v1.5→v1.6). A-02 LOW
  (verification-coverage-matrix: VP-024 draft Coverage Note added; v1.4→v1.5). D-01 LOW
  (BC-INDEX: PRD version-pin dropped for robustness — self-induced lag from P21 prd v1.19 bump;
  now version-agnostic; v1.25→v1.26). B-01 LOW (BC-INDEX: double-blank before ss-12 removed;
  v1.25→v1.26). Proactive version-citation robustness sweep run — only 1 current-state cross-doc
  version-pin found; now dropped. PG-ARP-F2-008 noted: 5th consecutive 0-CRIT/HIGH; corpus
  substantively converged; remaining churn cosmetic.
  Trajectory P14-22: 2C/5H→2C/1H→0C/0H→3C/2H→0C/3H→0C/8H→0C/1H→0C/0H→0C/0H. DECAYING strongly.
- Next action at time of archival: whole-corpus Pass 23 via Claude (first-clean candidate).

**Archived from STATE.md on:** 2026-06-13 (replaced by "Pass 24 REMEDIATED; 0C/1H; 7th consecutive 0-CRIT; B+C CLEAN" checkpoint)

### POSITION

- **23 adversarial passes + 1 corpus consistency audit run. Pass 23 REMEDIATED.**
- F2 adversarial convergence: STRICT WHOLE-CORPUS mode. Counter 0/3.
- Pass 23 (5 findings; Slices B/C/D all CLEAN; Slice A only): 0C/0H. A-01 MED (verification-
  coverage-matrix: VP-024 lock-note cited STORY-112/F6 — self-induced from P22 A-02; corrected
  to STORY-113/F6; v1.5→v1.6). A-02 LOW (verification-coverage-matrix: decoder.rs Sub-A
  attribution footnote; v1.5→v1.6). A-03 LOW (verification-architecture: VP-005 harness skeleton
  code-fence fixed; v1.6→v1.7). A-04 LOW (module-criticality: C-22 Modbus technique enumeration
  harmonized with C-23/C-24; v1.2→v1.3). A-05 LOW (arp-architecture-delta: §6 draft-as-
  authoritative note added; v1.10→v1.11). KEY: A-01 was self-induced churn. 3 of 4 slices CLEAN.
  Substantively + cosmetically near-converged. 6th consecutive 0-CRIT/HIGH.
  Trajectory P21-23: 0C/0H → 0C/0H → 0C/0H. DECAYING strongly.
- Next action at time of archival: whole-corpus Pass 24 via Claude (strong first-clean candidate).
